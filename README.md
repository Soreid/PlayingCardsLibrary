# PlayingCardsLibrary

This small code library simulates handling a standard deck of playing cards, utilizing interfaces for the option to extend programs to non-standard cards. Current functions include drawing the top card from the deck and shuffling the current deck portion.

Unit Tests are included through xunit to verify accuracy of the code.

A sample Console project is included to demonstrate the functionality currently in the library.
